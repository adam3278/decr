FAQ
---

Q: Must I fill host fields in configuration, when not use of Hostupdater?

A: Yes, because of adding it to apache2 sites configuration. Skipping it may cause syntax error.

Q: Why instances works so slow?!

A: They slow, bacuse of their type is seted to default. Switching to nfs is good idea, but your system must support it (sorry Windows users :( )

Q: Can I use vagrant provision multiple times?

A: Yes, it's for reinitialize purposes.
